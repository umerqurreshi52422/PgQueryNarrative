# PgQueryNarrative
PgQueryNarrative is a Go “Data Storyteller” for PostgreSQL. It runs read-only queries, profiles results, computes key metrics (trends, deltas, top drivers), then uses Ollama/Groq/Gemini to generate evidence-based narratives (headlines, takeaways) with anti-hallucination guardrails, plus a lightweight web UI and exports.
